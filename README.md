# M2U - Ayla
- MIDI visualizer
  - Original script by [-Mo-](http://github.com/TheMoMan/osu.storyboards/tree/master/Ayla) in Python, interpreted to C#
  - Thanks to [Himada](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/10959366) for figuring out how to use the [MIDI library](http://github.com/davidluzgouveia/midi-parser) (modified by me to use pointer parsing)
  - If you want to clone this project, you need to modify storybrew's code to allow unsafe code in projects
